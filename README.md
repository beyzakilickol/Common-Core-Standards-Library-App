* **Purpose of the app:** 
  Utilized various client-side, server-side frameworks and SQL by emphasizing database optimization including React,
Redux, Node, Express, PostgreSQL, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
 Developed an e-commerce app where teachers can shop online for class assignments, worksheets, coloring activities,
posters and curriculums based on the common core state standards. The state standards are pulled from CCSS API. Teachers are also allowed to become a seller to create and sell their own teaching materials. Teachers can reach out a variety of teaching materials created and used by other fellow teachers, add their items to the shop cart. They are able to make payment through Stripe Api.

## Register/Login: 
There are two user interfaces in the app. Regular buyers and sellers. When a user registers and logs in, he\she can make a search, filter products and purchase them. To be able to post and sell a product, user should be a seller. Header dropdown is adjusted based on the user type.

## Filter by Standards:
Since the main purpose of this app is searching class resources based on the common core standards, the majority of side bar filtering consists of different grades > Subjects > Standards. When user click the standard, all resources in regards to this standard will be displayed on the home page.
