posters and curriculums based on the common core state standards. The state standards are pulled from CCSS API. Teachers are also allowed to become a seller to create and sell their own teaching materials. Teachers can reach out a variety of teaching materials created and used by other fellow teachers, add their items to the shop cart. They are able to make payment through Stripe Api.
